This package provides a set of mixins for SQLAlchemy models
and a base class for all models.

The CRUD methods are defined in the `ActiveRecordMixin` class which
provides ActiveRecord-like behavior. It also inherits from
`SessionMixin` and `SmartQueryMixin` classes:

- `SessionMixin` class provides a session handler.
- `SmartQueryMixin` class adds smart query capabilities. It also inherits
from `InspectionMixin` class which provides helper methods for inspecting
the model.

The `ActiveRecordBaseModel` class is a base class for all models
that inherits from `ActiveRecordMixin` class which provides the set
of ActiveRecord-like helper methods for interacting with the database.
It also inherits from `TimestampMixin` class which adds the `created_at`
and `updated_at` timestamp columns.

It is recommended to define a `BaseModel` class that inherits from
`ActiveRecordBaseModel` and use it as the base class for all models
as shown in the following example:

```python
    from sqlalchemy import Mapped, mapped_column
    from sqlactive import ActiveRecordBaseModel

    class BaseModel(ActiveRecordBaseModel):
        __abstract__ = True

    class User(BaseModel):
        __tablename__ = 'users'
        id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
        name: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(100))

    # Create engine
    DATABASE_URL = 'sqlite+aiosqlite://'
    engine = create_async_engine(DATABASE_URL, echo=True)
    async_session_factory = async_sessionmaker(bind=engine, expire_on_commit=False)

    # Create session
    session = async_scoped_session(async_session_factory, scopefunc=asyncio.current_task)
    BaseModel.set_session(session)

    # Create tables
    BaseModel.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

`TimestampMixin` class defines the `created_at` and `updated_at` columns
with default values and onupdate behavior. To customize the column names,
override the `__created_at_name__` and `__updated_at_name__` class
variables as shown in the following example:

```python
    class MyModel(ActiveRecordBaseModel):
        __created_at_name__ = 'created_at'
        __updated_at_name__ = 'updated_at'
```

The `__datetime_func__` class variable can be used to override the default
datetime function as shown in the following example:

```python
    from sqlalchemy.sql import func

    class MyModel(ActiveRecordBaseModel):
        __datetime_func__ = func.current_timestamp()
```

To avoid adding the `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamp columns and
use only the ActiveRecord-like helper methods, don't inherit from
`ActiveRecordBaseModel` class. Instead, inherit from `ActiveRecordMixin`
as shown in the following example:

```python
    from sqlalchemy import Mapped, mapped_column
    from sqlactive import ActiveRecordMixin

    class BaseModel(ActiveRecordMixin):
        __abstract__ = True

    class User(BaseModel):
        __tablename__ = 'users'
        id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
        name: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(100))
```

To only add the `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamp columns, don't
inherit from `ActiveRecordMixin` class. Instead, inherit from
`TimestampMixin` as shown in the following example:

```python
    from sqlalchemy import Mapped, mapped_column
    from sqlactive import TimestampMixin

    class BaseModel(TimestampMixin):
        __abstract__ = True

    class User(BaseModel):
        __tablename__ = 'users'
        id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
        name: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(100))
```

NOTE: When defining a `BaseModel` class, don't forget to set `__abstract__` to `True`
in the base class to avoid creating tables for the base class.

### ActiveRecord-like methods
>>> bob = User.create(name='Bob')
>>> bob
# <User #1>
>>> bob.name
# Bob
>>> User.where(name='Bob').all()
# [<User #1>]
>>> User.get(1)
# <User #1>
>>> bob.update(name='Bob2')
>>> bob.name
# Bob2
>>> bob.to_dict()
# {'id': 2, 'name': 'Bob2'}
>>> bob.delete()
>>> User.all()
# []

### DBConnection helper
To create a DB connection, create a instance of the `DBConnection` class and call the `init_db` method
as shown in the following example:
```python
    from sqlactive import ActiveRecordBaseModel, DBConnection

    class BaseModel(ActiveRecordBaseModel):
        __abstract__ = True

    DATABASE_URL = 'sqlite+aiosqlite://'
    conn = DBConnection(DATABASE_URL, echo=True)
    asyncio.run(conn.init_db(BaseModel))
```

If no base model is provided, the `ActiveRecordBaseModel` class will be used as the base model:
```python
    from sqlactive import DBConnection

    DATABASE_URL = 'sqlite+aiosqlite://'
    conn = DBConnection(DATABASE_URL, echo=True)
    asyncio.run(conn.init_db())
```
